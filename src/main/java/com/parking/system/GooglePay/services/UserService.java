    /*
    Design a system similar to Google Pay. Google Pay is a mobile payment and digital wallet platform that allows users to make payments, send money, and store payment information securely.

    Your task is to design a high-level architecture for Google Pay, considering the following requirements:
    1. User Registration and Authentication: Users should be able to register and authenticate themselves securely to access the Google Pay platform.
    2. Payment Methods: Users should be able to link multiple payment methods, such as credit cards, debit cards, and bank accounts, to their Google Pay account.
    3. Money Transfer: Users should be able to send money to other users within the Google Pay ecosystem easily.
    4. Payment Integration: Google Pay should be integrated with various merchants and service providers to enable users to make payments for goods and services using the platform.
    5. Security: The system should ensure secure transmission and storage of user payment information, including encryption and tokenization mechanisms.
    6. Transaction History: Users should be able to view their transaction history, including details of payments made and received.
    7. Notifications: Users should receive real-time notifications for transaction updates, payment requests, and other relevant information.
    8. Scalability and Performance: The system should be designed to handle a large user base and process transactions efficiently to provide a seamless experience.
    Your design should focus on the overall architecture, key components, and interactions between various modules of the system. You should also consider factors such as data storage, data synchronization, API integrations with banks and payment processors, and any other relevant aspects of a secure and robust payment platform.
    9. Google Pay with the functionality of QR code payment, Bank transfer, Pay to contact and pay history
    Please provide a high-level overview of your design, along with any relevant diagrams, key interfaces, and considerations for scalability and performance.
